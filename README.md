This repository contains data and scripts used in the following paper:

Craig, O.E., Lundy, J., Bondetti, M., Nicholson-Lailey, S., Murakami,N., Szuki ,M ., Stevens, C.,  Lucquin, A., Talbot, H..M, Son, J.H. Fujio, S., Sakamoto, M., Yamashita, Y., Kobayashi, K., Crema, E.R., Shoda, S. (2025), Lipid residue analysis reveals divergent culinary practices in Japan and Korea at the dawn of intensive agriculture

The repository is organised into the following directories:

* _Data_ ... contains all raw data required for analyses
* _Isotopesandmap_ ... contains R scripts for generating figures pertaining human stable isotope data
* _organicresidues_ ... contains R scripts and resulting outputs for analysing organic residues from ceramics
* _c14dates_ ... contains R scripts and resulting outputs for the analyses of radiocarbon dates.
* _figures_ ... contains figure outputs used in the manuscript.

Each analysis directory (_Isotopesandmap_,_organicresidues_, and _c14dates_) is self-contained and can be executed independently.  

### Data 

The data directory contains CSV files required for all analyses and directly referenced in the manuscript (e.g. 'Dataset S1'):
